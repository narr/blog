### Given a package with a weight limit and an array of item weights, how can you most efficiently find two items with sum of weights that equals the weight limit?

### Your function should return 2 such indices of item weights or -1 if such pair doesn't exist. What is the runtime and space complexity of your solution?

#### example:

```javascript
findComplementingWeights([2, 4, 8, 14], 12);
// [1, 2] or [2, 1]
```
